### Tartarus-Driver
```Open source Linux driver for the Razer Tartarus V2```

### About

This is my first attempt at a driver, so who knows what will become of this repository!<br>
Ideally, the final stage for this driver will replace any default driver for the Tartarus.
It should function as a standard keyboard would, with the primary exception of reading the keybind configuration from a file.<br>
Admittedly, this will be a big learning experience for me, as I know little enough about drivers to fully understand if what I'm hoping this will do will be viable.
